# Weather Prediction Machine Learning Project
## Overview
The Weather Prediction Machine Learning Project is a predictive modeling endeavor aimed at forecasting weather conditions based on historical data. 
Leveraging machine learning techniques, this project seeks to provide accurate and reliable predictions for various weather parameters, including temperature, 
humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure.

## Objectives
- Develop machine learning models capable of accurately predicting weather conditions for specific locations and timeframes.
- Enhance the understanding of complex atmospheric patterns and their impact on weather phenomena.
- Provide valuable insights for various stakeholders, including meteorologists, agricultural industries, transportation services, and outdoor event planners.
- Continuously improve the accuracy and reliability of weather forecasts through iterative model refinement and data optimization.

## Data collection
OpenWeatherMap (http://openweathermap.org) provides historic and current weather data through APIs (http://openweathermap.org/api)
